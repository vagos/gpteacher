      "[Document(page_content='Professor Steven Smith:\\nThere is one person in here, I don\\'t know who it is,\\nand you will not know who it is yet, but there is one person in\\nhere for whom the reading of Plato\\'s Republic will be\\nthe most important intellectual experience you have at Yale. It is a book that one of you\\nwill go back to time and time again and it will stick with you\\nforever. What I would like you to do is\\nto remember this and four years from now, when most of you are\\nready to graduate, if that one person in here\\nwould email me and let me know who it is, okay? Maybe it will be you.\\nMaybe? Possibly.\\nOr you. Okay.\\nThis is the book that started it all.\\nThe Apology, the Crito,\\nthese are warm-ups to the big theme, to the big book,\\nthe Republic. Every other book in this\\npolitical science that has since been written,\\nbeginning with Aristotle\\'s Politics and moving on to\\nthe present day is, in one way or another,\\nan answer, a response to Plato\\'s Republic.\\nIt started the whole thing. The first and most obvious\\nthing to say about the Republic is that it is a\\nlong book. Not the longest book you will\\never read, but long enough. In fact, in part,\\nbecause of this, we are only reading\\napproximately half the book, the first five books,\\nto be more specific. The first five books that deal\\nwith and culminate in the best city, Plato\\'s ideal city,\\nwhat he calls Kallipolis, the just city,\\nthe beautiful city, ruled by philosopher-kings.\\nThe second half of the book turns in somewhat different,\\ncertainly equally important directions,\\nbut would take us much more time than the time we have\\nallotted to deal with. So you will read that on your\\nown. You can take another course,\\nwhat have you. The Republic is a very\\nperplexing book, you will find out.\\nIts meaning will not be evident to you on a first reading.\\nIt may not be clear to you on a tenth reading,\\nunless you approach it with the proper questions and the proper\\nframe of mind. So let\\'s start by asking a\\nsimple question. What is the Republic\\nabout? What does this book deal with? This is a question that has\\nperplexed and divided readers of Plato almost from the beginning.\\nIs it a book about justice, as the subtitle of the book\\nsuggests? Is it a book about what we\\ntoday might call moral psychology and the right\\nordering of the human soul, which is a prominent theme\\naddressed in this work? Is it a book about the power of\\npoetry and myth, what we would call the whole\\ndomain of culture to shape souls and to shape our societies?\\nOr is it a book about metaphysics and the ultimate\\nstructure of being, as certainly many of the later\\nbooks of the Republic suggest?\\nThe theory of the forms, the image of the divided line\\nand so on and so on. Of course, it is about all of\\nthese things and several others as well.\\nBut at least at the beginning, when we approach the book,\\nwe should stay on its surface, not dig at least initially too\\ndeeply. As one of the great readers of\\nPlato of the last century once said, \"Only the surface of\\nthings reveals the essence of things.\"\\nThe surface of the Republic reveals that it\\nis a dialogue. It is a conversation.\\nWe should approach the book, in other words,\\nnot as we might a treatise, but as we might approach a work\\nof literature or drama. It is a work comparable in\\nscope to other literary masterworks--Hamlet,\\nDon Quixote, War and Peace,\\nothers you might think of. As a conversation,\\nas a dialogue, it is something the author\\nwants us to join, to take part in.\\nWe are invited to be not merely passive onlookers of this\\nconversation, but active participants in that\\ndialogue that takes place in this book over the course of a\\nsingle evening. Perhaps the best way to read\\nthis book is to read it aloud, as you might with a play,\\nto yourself or with your friends. Let\\'s go a little further.\\nThe Republic is also a utopia, a word that Plato does\\nnot use, was not coined until many, many centuries later by\\nSir Thomas More. But Plato\\'s book is a utopia.\\nIt is a kind of extreme. He presents an extreme vision\\nof politics. He presents an extreme vision\\nof the polis. The guiding thread of the book\\nis the correspondence, and we will look at this in\\nsome length and you will discuss it in your sections,\\nno doubt. The guiding thread of the book\\nis the correspondence, the symmetry between the parts\\nof the city and the parts of the soul.\\nDiscord within the city, just as discord within the\\nsoul, is regarded as the greatest evil.\\nThe aim of the Republic is to establish a harmonious\\ncity, based on a conception of justice that,\\nso to speak, harmonizes the individual and\\nsociety, how to achieve that. The best city would necessarily\\nbe one that seeks to produce the best or highest type of\\nindividual. Plato\\'s famous answer to this\\nis that this city--any city--will never be free of\\nconflict, will never be free of factional\\nstrife until, in his famous formula,\\nkings become philosophers and philosophers become kings. The Republic asks us to\\nconsider seriously, what would a city look like\\nruled by philosophers? In this respect,\\nit would seem to be the sort of perfect bookend to the\\nApology. Remember, the Apology\\nviewed the dangers posed to philosophy and the philosopher\\nand the philosophical life from the city.\\nThe Republic asks us, what would a city be like if it\\nwere ruled by Socrates or someone like him?\\nWhat would it be like for philosophers to rule?\\nSuch a city would require, so Socrates tells us throughout\\nthe opening books, the severe censorship of poetry\\nand theology, the abolition of private\\nproperty and the family, at least among the guardian\\nclass of the city, and the use of selected lies\\nand myths, what would today probably be\\ncalled ideology or propaganda, as tools of political rule.\\nIt would seem that far from utopia, the Republic\\nrepresents a radical dystopia, a satire, in some sense,\\nof the best polity. In fact, much of modern\\npolitical science is directed against Plato\\'s legacy.\\nThe modern state, as we have come to understand\\nit, is based upon the separation of civil society from governing\\nauthority. The entire domain of what we\\ncall private life separated from the state.\\nBut Plato\\'s Republic recognizes no such separation or\\nno such independence for a private sphere.\\nFor this reason, Plato has often been cast as a\\nkind of harbinger of the modern totalitarian state. A famous professor at a distant\\nuniversity was said to have begun his lectures on the\\nRepublic by saying, \"Now we will consider Plato,\\nthe fascist.\" This was, in fact,\\nthe view popularized by one of the most influential books about\\nPlato written in the last century,\\na book written by a Viennese émigré by the name of Karl\\nPopper, who in the very early 1950s,\\nright at the height of the Cold War and of course the end of the\\nconclusion of the Second World War,\\nwrote a book called The Open Society and Its Enemies.\\nHe wanted to know what were the causes or who was responsible\\nfor the experiences of totalitarianism,\\nboth in Stalin\\'s Russia and in Hitler\\'s Germany.\\nIn the course of this inquiry, he concluded that not only\\nHegel and Marx were important in that particular genealogy,\\nbut this went back to Plato as well, Plato principally.\\nPlato, who Popper accuses in a passionate, albeit not very well\\nwritten book, accuses Plato of being the\\nfirst to establish a kind of totalitarian dictatorship.\\nIs that true? Plato\\'s Republic is,\\nwe will discover as you read, a republic of a very special\\nkind. It is not a regime like ours\\ndevoted to maximizing individual liberties, but it is one that\\nputs the education of its citizens,\\nthe education of its members, as its highest duty. The Republic,\\nlike the Greek polis, was a kind of tutelary\\nassociation. Its principal good,\\nits principal goal, was the education of citizens\\nfor positions of public leadership and high political\\nresponsibilities. It is always worthwhile to\\nremember that Plato was, above all, a teacher.\\nHe was the founder of the first university, the Academy,\\nthe Platonic Academy, where we will find out later\\nAristotle came to study, among many others--Aristotle\\nbeing but the most famous. Plato was the founder of this\\nschool. This, in turn,\\nspawned other philosophical schools throughout the Greek\\nworld and later, the Roman world.\\nWith the demise of Rome, in the early Christian\\ncenturies, these philosophical academies,\\nthese philosophical schools, were absorbed into the medieval\\nmonasteries. These, in turn,\\nbecame the basis of the first European universities in places\\nlike Bologna, Paris, Oxford.\\nThese were, in turn, later transplanted to the New\\nWorld and established in towns like Cambridge and,\\nof course, New Haven. We can say today that this\\nuniversity is a direct ancestor of the platonic republic of\\nPlato\\'s Academy. We are all here the heirs of\\nPlato. Think of that.\\nWithout Plato, no Yale. We would not be here today. I think that is a fact. Just ponder that for a moment. In fact, let me even say a\\nlittle more about this. The institutional and\\neducational requirements of Plato\\'s Republic share\\nmany features with a place like Yale.\\nFor example, in both the Platonic\\nKallipolis, the just city, as well as this place,\\nmen and women--men and women--are selected at a\\nrelatively early age because of their capacities for leadership,\\nfor courage, for self-discipline,\\nand responsibility. They spend several years living\\ntogether, eating together in common mess halls,\\nexercising together, and studying together,\\nof course, far from the oversight of their parents.\\nThe best of them are winnowed out to pursue further study and\\neventually assume positions of public leadership and\\nresponsibility. Throughout all of this,\\nthey are subjected to a course of rigorous study and physical\\ntraining that will lead them to adopt prominent positions in the\\nmilitary and other branches of public service.\\nDoes this sound at all familiar to you?\\nIt should. Let me put it another way.\\nIf Plato is a fascist, what does that make you? Plato, of course,\\nis an extremist. He pushes his ideas to their\\nmost radical conclusions. That\\'s what it is to be a\\nphilosopher. But he is also defining a kind\\nof school. He regards the Politea\\nor the Republic, because that is the original\\nGreek title of the book, Politea or regime.\\nHe regards the politea as a school whose chief goal is\\npreparation for guidance and leadership of a community.\\nIf you don\\'t believe me about this, maybe you will consider\\nthe words of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, one of the great\\nreaders of Plato\\'s Republic.\\nRousseau wrote in his Emile,\\n\"To get a good idea of public education,\" he says,\\n\"read Plato\\'s Republic. It is not a political treatise,\\nas those who merely judge books by their title think,\\nbut it is the finest, most beautiful work on\\neducation ever written.\" Rousseau.\\nSo, there we go. Let\\'s now peek into the book\\nitself. Just peek.\\nWe won\\'t go too far. Let\\'s start with the first line. Who remembers what the first\\nline is? Oh, come on.\\nYou should know this. You\\'re looking at the book.\\nYou\\'re cheating. \"I went down to the Piraeus.\"\\nI went down to the Piraeus. Why does Plato begin with this\\nline? There\\'s a story that I heard.\\nI\\'m not sure if it\\'s altogether true, but it\\'s a good story,\\nat least, about the famous German philosopher Martin\\nHeidegger, who said that on his first\\nteaching of the Republic, he went through the whole book,\\ntaught the whole book in one seminar, one semester.\\nThe last time he taught it, the final time he taught it,\\nhe never got beyond the first sentence, \"I went down to the\\nPiraeus.\" What does it mean?\\nWhy does he begin with this? \"I went down,\" a going down.\\nThe Greek word for this is catabasis.\\n\"I had made a descent.\" There is a book by a famous\\ncontemporary to Plato. It\\'s a man named Xenophon,\\nwho wrote a book called the Anabasis.\\nThe anabasis means a going up, an ascent.\\nBut Plato begins this dialogue with this stigma.\\n\"I went down.\" The descent to the Piraeus.\\nIt is clearly modeled on Odysseus\\' descent to Hades in\\nthe Odyssey. In fact, the work is a kind of\\nphilosophical odyssey that both imitates Homer,\\nbut also anticipates other great odysseys of the human\\nmind, works by those like Cervantes or Joyce.\\nThe book is full, you will see,\\nof a number of descents and ascents.\\nThe most famous climb upward, although we will not actually\\nread these parts for this class, concerns the climb to the\\ndivided line, the famous image of the divided\\nline in Book VI, and the ascent to the world of\\nthe imperishable forms. Then, in the last book of the\\nRepublic, Book X, there is,\\nonce again, a descent to the underworld, to the world of\\nHades. The work is not,\\nin a sense, written simply as a sort of timeless philosophical\\ntreatise, but as a dramatic dialogue with\\na setting, a cast of characters and a firm location in time and\\nplace. Let\\'s say a little more about\\nthat time and place already indicated in the sentence,\\n\"I went down to the Piraeus.\" Plato was born in 427,\\nwhich is four years after the commencement of the\\nPeloponnesian War. He was a young man of 23 when\\nthe democracy in Athens was defeated.\\nHe was only 28 when the restored democracy executed his\\nfriend and teacher, Socrates, in 399. Almost immediately after the\\ntrial of Socrates, Plato left Athens and traveled\\nextensively throughout the Greek world.\\nUpon his return, he established this school at\\nAthens he called the Academy, for the training of\\nphilosophers, statesmen, and legislators.\\nPlato lived a long time. He lived until the age of 80.\\nExcept for two expeditions to Sicily, where he went at the\\nrequest of Dionysius to help try to establish a philosophical\\nkingship in Syracuse, he remained in Athens teaching\\nand writing. The Republic belongs to\\nthat period of Plato\\'s work after his return to Athens,\\nafter the execution of Socrates.\\nThe dominant feature of Plato\\'s political theory,\\nDavid Grene, a great reader of Plato,\\nhas said is \"the root and branch character of the change\\nit advocates and existing institutions.\"\\nPlato\\'s desire for a kind of radical makeover,\\nof Athenian and Greek political institutions and cultures,\\ngrew out of his experience of political defeat and despair.\\nThe utopianism of the book is, in many ways,\\nthe reverse side of the sense of profound disillusionment that\\nhe felt at the actual experience of the Athenian polis.\\nThis was not only true of his experience at home,\\nbut of his failed efforts to turn Dionysius\\' kingship in\\nSicily into a successful example of philosophical rule.\\nIn fact, we have--and I want to read to you in just a moment--a\\nlengthy transcript of Plato\\'s own account of why he came to\\nwrite the Republic. One thing, of course,\\nyou note in the Republic,\\nis that Plato is nowhere present.\\nHe is not a participant in his own dialogue.\\nHe is the author, but not the participant.\\nWe don\\'t know precisely what Plato thought,\\nbut we are helped, at least, by a kind of\\nintellectual autobiography that he wrote and that we still have,\\nin what is conventionally referred to as The Seventh\\nLetter. Plato wrote a series of letters\\nthat we have. People have argued over the\\nauthenticity of them, although I think by now it is\\nestablished that they are his. In the most famous of these\\nletters, the lengthy seventh one, he gives us,\\nagain, something of an autobiography\\nand tells us a little bit about why he came to write this book.\\nIsn\\'t this amazing that 2,000-2,500 years ago,\\nwe still have the letters of the man who wrote this book?\\nLet me read to you what Plato says about how he came to write\\nthis book. \"When I was a young man,\" he\\nsaid--and this is written as he is very old.\\n\"When I was a young man, I felt as yet many young men\\ndo. I felt at the very moment I\\nattained my majority I should engage in public affairs.\\nAnd there came my way an opportunity that I want to tell\\nyou about. The democratic constitution,\\nthen loudly decried by many people, was abolished.\\nAnd the leaders of the revolution set themselves up as\\na government of 30 men with supreme authority.\"\\nHe\\'s referring to the Tyranny of the Thirty that existed after\\nthe Athenian defeat. \"Some of these men ,\\nyou must understand, were relatives of mine and well\\nknown to me. And what is more,\\nthey actually invited me at once to join them,\\nas though politics and I were a fit match.\\nI was very young then and it is not surprising that I felt as I\\ndid. I thought that the city was\\nthen living a kind of life which was unjust and that they would\\nbend it to a just one and so administer it more justly.\\nSo I eagerly watched to see what they would do.\\nAnd you must know, as I looked on,\\nI saw those men in a short time make the former democracy look\\nlike a golden age.\" He is referring to his\\nrelatives, men like Critias and Charmides, who turned Athenian\\npolitics into a tyranny and, which he says,\\nmakes the \"democracy look like a golden age.\"\\nLet me continue in Plato\\'s words.\\n\"I looked at this, you see, and at the men who\\nwere in politics, at the laws and customs.\\nAnd the more I looked and the older I grew,\\nthe more difficult it seemed to me to administer political\\naffairs justly. For you cannot do so without\\nfriends and comrades you can trust.\\nIn such men it was not easy to find.\\nFor the city, you see, no longer lived in the\\nfashion and ways of our fathers. Eager as I had once been to go\\ninto politics, as I look at these things and\\nsaw everything taking any course at all with no direction or\\nmanagement, I ended up feeling dizzy.\\nI did not abandon my interest in politics to discover how it\\nmight be bettered in other respects, and I was perpetually\\nawaiting my opportunity. But at last,\\nI saw that as far as all states now existing are concerned,\\nthey are all badly governed. For the condition of their laws\\nis bad almost past cure, except for some miraculous\\naccident. So I was compelled to say,\\nin praising true philosophy, that it was from it alone that\\nwas able to discern any justice. And so I said that the nations\\nof the world will never cease from trouble until either the\\ntrue breed of philosophers shall come to political office or\\nuntil that of the rulers shall, by some divine law,\\ntake the pursuit of philosophy.\"\\nThere you see in that wonderful and a kind of probing\\nself-examination of his early motives and expectations,\\nyou see the disillusionment of the older Plato looking on what\\nthe Tyranny had done. But also looking at the states,\\nthe nations of his time, seeing their management,\\nseeing their decay and conflict and saying and suggesting that\\nno justice will ever be expected until,\\nas he says at the end, kings become philosophers and\\nphilosophers kings, a direct reference to the\\nRepublic. This little autobiography,\\ngoes on at considerably greater length, I should say.\\nBut this provides a kind of introduction,\\nas it were, to the Republic.\\nWe have in Plato\\'s own words here, the way he viewed politics\\nand his reasons for his political philosophy.\\nYet, in many respects, if the Republic was the\\nresult of comprehensive despair and disillusionment with the\\nprospects of reform, the dialogue itself points back\\nto an earlier moment in Plato\\'s life and the life of the city of\\nAthens. This remarkable letter was\\nwritten when Plato was very old, approximately 50 years after\\nthe trial and execution of Socrates.\\nBut the action of the Republic takes place long\\nbefore the defeat of Athens, before the rise of the Thirty\\nand the execution of Athens . It refers to that period that\\nPlato says in the letter looked like \"a golden age,\\nwhen many things seemed possible.\"\\nThat brings us back to the opening, the descent to the\\nPiraeus. The action of the dialogue\\nbegins at the Piraeus, the port city of Athens,\\nsomewhere around the year 411, during what was called the\\nPeace of Nicias, that is to say,\\nthe peace that endured a kind of respite,\\ntruce that was established during the fighting between\\nSparta and Athens. At the very beginning of the\\ndialogue, we see Socrates and his friend Glaucon.\\nWhat are they doing? What are they doing? Do you remember?\\nWhat are they doing at the very beginning?\\nStudent: Professor Steven Smith: Where?\\nStudent: [inaudible] Professor Steven Smith:\\nRight. Let me put it a slightly--yes,\\nthey are walking back to Athens from the Piraeus.\\nBut maybe to put it a slightly different way,\\nthey\\'re trolling the waterfront.\\nWhat is the Piraeus? It is the harbor of Athens.\\nWhat do you expect from harbors? What are harbor cities like?\\nWhat do you find down at harbors?\\nStudent: [inaudible] Professor Steven Smith:\\nWater, yeah. They\\'re seedy, aren\\'t they?\\nYou find various kinds of disreputable and maybe unseemly\\nthings going on there. We are forced to ask ourselves:\\nWhat are Socrates and Glaucon doing there?\\nWhy are they there together? What are they doing?\\nWhat do they expect to find? These seem to be questions that\\nimmediately come to mind. We learn shortly afterwards\\nthat they have taken this descent to the Piraeus to view a\\nfestival, a kind of carnival. It sounds like something one\\nmight expect to see in a Fellini film.\\nA kind of carnival, a carnivale,\\na Mardi Gras, where a festival is going on.\\nWhat\\'s more, a new goddess is being\\nintroduced into the pantheon of deities.\\nThis seems to suggest that--referring back to the\\nApology, that it is not Socrates,\\nbut the Athenians who innovate, who create and introduce new\\ndeities. Socrates remarks that the\\nThracians, the display of the Thracians, put on a good show,\\nshowing that his own perspective is not simply bound\\nby that of a city. It suggests,\\nfrom the beginning, a kind of loftiness and\\nimpartiality of perspective characteristic of the\\nphilosopher, but not necessarily the citizen.\\nOn their way back from this festival, from this carnival,\\non their way back they\\'re accosted, you remember.\\nThey\\'re accosted by a slave who\\'s been sent on by\\nPolemarchus and his friends and who orders Socrates and Glaucon\\nto wait. \"Polemarchus orders you to\\nwait,\" the slave says. He orders you to wait.\\nHe is coming up behind you. Just wait. \"Of course we\\'ll wait,\" Glaucon\\nreplies. When Polemarchus and his\\nfriends arrive, we find that his friends\\ninclude Adeimantus, who is Glaucon\\'s brother and\\nNiceratus, who is the son of Nicias, the general who has just\\nbrokered the peace that they are now enjoying.\\nThat\\'s the famous Peace of Nicias.\\nThey challenge Socrates. \"Stay with us or prove\\nstronger.\" Stay with us or prove stronger.\\n\"Could we not persuade you?\" Socrates asked.\\n\"Could we not persuade you to let us go?\"\\n\"Not if we won\\'t listen,\" Polemarchus says.\\nInstead, they reach a compromise.\\nBut Socrates and Glaucon come with Polemarchus and the others\\nto the home of Polemarchus\\' father,\\nwhere dinner will be provided for them, and later,\\na return to the festival where there will be a horseback race.\\n\"It seems,\" Glaucon says, \"we must stay.\"\\nAnd Socrates concurs. Why does the book begin with\\nthis, let\\'s say, opening gambit?\\nIs it simply a ruse to get the reader\\'s attention in some sense\\nor to rope you in with some promise of what\\'s to follow?\\nAlready from the very opening lines we see in this a clue to\\nthe theme that is going to follow.\\nWho has the title to rule? Is it Polemarchus and his\\nfriends who claim to rule by strength of numbers?\\n\"Can we persuade you?\" \"Not if we don\\'t listen,\" he\\nsays. Or Socrates and Glaucon,\\nwho hope to rule by the powers of reason, speech,\\nand argument? Can we convince you?\\nCan we persuade you? Can democracy that expresses\\nthe will of the majority, the will of the greater number\\nbe rendered compatible with the needs of philosophy and the\\nclaims to respect only reason and a better argument?\\nThat seems to be the question already posed in this opening\\nscene. Can a compromise be reached\\nbetween the two? Can the strength of numbers,\\nas well as respect for reason and a better argument be,\\nin some sense, harmonized?\\nCan they be brought together? Is the just city,\\nperhaps, that Socrates will later consider,\\na combination of these two--of both force and persuasion?\\nThat will be something left to see.\\nBut I think you can see the big themes of the book already very\\npresent in the opening scene of the dialogue.\\nThe first book is really a kind of preamble to everything that\\nfollows. Okay?\\nAre you with me so far on this? Let\\'s talk a little bit about\\nthe participants in this dialogue.\\nIt is a dialogue. It has a fairly large number of\\ncharacters, although only a relatively few number of them\\nspeak in the book. Yet, it\\'s something very\\nimportant, as we would want to know in any play or novel or\\nmovie. We want to note something about\\nthe particular people who inhabit this dinner party that\\nSocrates and Glaucon have been promised.\\nWho are they and what do they represent? There is Cephalus,\\nwho we will see very quickly, the father of Polemarchus and\\nwhose home they are attending. The venerable\\npaterfamilias, the venerable father of the\\nfamily. Polemarchus,\\nhis son, a solid patriot who defends not only his father\\'s\\nhonor, but that of his friends and fellow citizens.\\nWe will also see Thrasymachus, a cynical intellectual who\\nrivals Socrates as an educator of future leaders and statesmen.\\nOf course, it is the exchange between Socrates and\\nThrasymachus that is one of the most famous moments of the book.\\nThere is, in the first set of dialogues, a distinct hierarchy\\nof characters, you might say,\\nwho we see later on express those distinctive features of\\nthe soul and the city. Cephalus, we learn,\\nhas spent his life in the acquisitive arts.\\nThat is to say, he\\'s a businessman.\\nHe\\'s been concerned with satisfying the needs of his body\\nand making money. He represents what will later\\nbe called in the Republic the appetitive part of the soul,\\nthe appetites. Polemarchus,\\nwhose name actually means \"warlord.\"\\nThink of that. The warlord is preoccupied with\\nquestions of honor and loyalty. He tells us,\\nto get a little bit ahead of ourselves, that justice is\\nhelping your friends and harming your enemies.\\nHe seems to represent what Plato or Socrates will later\\ncall the spirited part of the soul, something that we want to\\nreturn to. Thrasymachus,\\na visiting sophist, seeks to teach and educate,\\nanticipating what the Republic will call the\\nrational soul, the rational part of the soul.\\nEach of these figures, in many ways,\\nprefigure the relatively superior natures of those who\\ncome later in the dialogue. The two brothers,\\nGlaucon and Adeimantus, whose exchange with Socrates\\noccupies, for the most part,\\nthe rest of the dialogue from Book Two onward,\\nthe two brothers who, incidentally,\\nare the brothers of Plato. I should say,\\nto my knowledge, we know nothing more about\\nGlaucon and Adeimantus from history, but Plato put them into\\nhis dialogue. They will always be remembered\\nas the two brothers in the dialogue.\\nAgain, they seem to represent something quite different.\\nBear this in mind as you are reading the book,\\nbecause it is easy to kind of forget who\\'s talking and what\\nthey represent. Adeimantus is,\\nwe will find, the kind of hedonistic and\\npleasure-seeking brother. Glaucon, whose name means\\nsomething like \"gleaming\", \"shining,\" is the fierce and\\nwar-like of the two brothers. Of course, there is the\\nphilosophically-minded Socrates. Again, each of them seems to\\nrepresent, in a superior way, the key components of the human\\nsoul, the appetitive,\\nthe war-like or spirited, and the rational.\\nTogether, these figures form a kind of microcosm of humanity.\\nEach of the participants in the dialogue represents one of the\\nspecific classes or groups that will eventually occupy the just\\ncity to which Plato or Socrates gives the name Kallipolis,\\nthe beautiful city. Alright? In the five minutes or so that\\nremain, let\\'s just talk for a moment about the first\\nconversation with the head of the family, Cephalus.\\nWe don\\'t need to look at this at great length.\\nYou can, I\\'m sure in your sections, you might want to talk\\nabout the arguments a little more specifically that are used\\nin these first three sets of conversations between Cephalus,\\nPolemarchus, and Thrasymachus. The question,\\nmore importantly-- the question, I don\\'t know that it\\'s\\nmore importantly, but the question that I want us\\nto examine a little bit here in the time remaining is what,\\nagain, these characters represent.\\nCephalus, as his name implies, Cephalus.\\nWhat does that mean? Do you know?\\nHead, yes, Cephalus, head, the head of the\\nhousehold, but also clearly the claims of age,\\nof tradition, of family.\\nAt the beginning of the dialogue when Polemarchus\\nbrought his friends back to the house, we see the aged father,\\nCephalus. He is just returning from\\nprayer. He has just returned from\\nperforming certain acts of ritual sacrifice.\\nHe greets Socrates, in many ways,\\nas a long, lost friend. Perhaps you have had this\\nexperience yourself, always a slightly uncomfortable\\none. When you bring a group of your\\nfriends back to your house, you\\'re expecting to have a good\\ntime, and your grandparent is there\\nand says, \"Oh, it\\'s so good to see a bunch of\\nyoung people. I want to talk with you.\"\\nIt\\'s always a slightly uncomfortable moment,\\nyou might say. We all have experienced this\\nkind of thing. Everybody knows it from either\\nend. I\\'m not a grandparent,\\nthank god. But I feel the same thing often\\nwhen my son brings his friends, maybe that I\\'ve known for a\\nlong time. \"Oh, how are you doing?\"\\nand they want to get away. Socrates does something rather\\nabrupt. \"Tell me, Cephalus,\\nwhat\\'s it like to be so old?\" \"What is it like to be like\\nyou?\" \"Do you still feel the need for\\nsex?\" Can you imagine saying that to\\nsomeone\\'s grandfather? It gives you a little idea of\\nthe character of Socrates. Cephalus is so happy.\\n\"Oh, thank god I\\'m past that,\" he says.\\n\"Thank god I no longer feel this erotic desire.\\nAt my old age, I can spend my time--\" \"When I\\nwas a young man, that\\'s all I did.\\nI was thinking about sex all the time and when I wasn\\'t\\nthinking about that, I was making money.\\nBut now I\\'ve had my fill of both and I can spend my later\\nyears, the twilight of my life, turning to the things about the\\ngods, performing sacrifices commanded by the gods.\"\\nWhy does Plato begin this way? Well, Cephalus is,\\nas should be clear, the very embodiment of the\\nconventional, in both senses of that term.\\nHe\\'s not a bad man, by any means.\\nBut he is a thoroughly unreflective one.\\nIn attacking Cephalus as he does, Socrates attacks the\\nembodiment of conventional opinion, the Nomos supporting\\nthe city. Note the way Socrates\\nmanipulates the dialogue, the conversation.\\nCephalus says that the pious man, the just man practices\\njustice by sacrificing to the gods.\\nSocrates turns that into the statement that justice means\\npaying your debts and returning what is owed to you.\\nCephalus, in an easygoing manner, agrees and then Socrates\\nsays, \"What would you think about returning a weapon that\\nyou had borrowed from a friend or someone who was in a very\\ndepressed\"--we might say a depressed \"frame of mind.\\nWould that be just? How do you explain that?\\nWould you do that if justice means paying your debts and\\ngiving back to each what is owed?\"\\nAt that moment, Cephalus excuses himself from\\nthe dialogue and says, rather abruptly,\\n\"I have to go out and continue my sacrifices in the garden.\"\\nSocrates, in other words, has broken the bond of\\ntradition and traditional authority that holds the ancient\\ncity and the ancient family together.\\nCephalus is banished from the dialogue.\\nTradition is banished and we never hear another word about it\\nfor the next 400 or so pages. That\\'s the way Socrates begins\\nthis dialogue, or that\\'s the way Plato has\\nSocrates begin it. We\\'ll look a little more at\\nsome of these in our class for next time and then move into the\\ncharacters of Adeimantus and Glaucon.\\nAnyway, start your reading. Continue your reading.\\nYour sections are going on this week, so enjoy yourselves.', metadata={'source': \"4. Philosophers and Kings： Plato's Republic, I-II [nVQKbQVc2_w].en\", 'lecture_name': 'lecture1', 'type': 'transcript'}), Document(page_content='Okay, welcome back. Today we\\'re gonna cover a couple separate two main topics related to the shell. First, we\\'re gonna do some kind of shell\\nscripting, mainly related to bash, which is the shell that most of you will start in Mac, or like in most Linux systems,\\nthat\\'s the default shell. And it\\'s also kind of backward compatible through\\nother shells like zsh, it\\'s pretty nice. And then we\\'re gonna cover some other shell\\ntools that are really convenient, so you avoid doing really repetitive tasks, like looking for some piece of code or for some elusive file. And there are already really\\nnice built-in commands that will really help you to do those things. So yesterday we already kind of introduced you to the shell and some of it\\'s quirks, and like how you start executing commands, redirecting them. Today, we\\'re going to kind of cover more about the syntax of the variables, the control flow, functions of the shell. So for example, once you drop\\ninto a shell, say you want to define a variable, which is\\none of the first things you learn to do in a programming language. Here you could do something like foo equals bar. And now we can access the value\\nof foo by doing \"$foo\". And that\\'s bar, perfect. One quirk that you need to be aware of is that spaces are really critical when\\nyou\\'re dealing with bash. Mainly because spaces are reserved, and\\nthat will be for separating arguments. So, for example, something like foo equals bar won\\'t work, and the shell is gonna\\ntell you why it\\'s not working. It\\'s because the foo command is not\\nworking, like foo is non-existent. And here what is actually happening,\\nwe\\'re not assigning foo to bar, what is happening is we\\'re\\ncalling the foo program with the first argument \"=\" and\\nthe second argument \"bar\". And in general, whenever you are having\\nsome issues, like some files with spaces you will need to be careful about that. You need to be careful about quoting strings. So, going into that, how you do strings in bash.\\nThere are two ways that you can define a string: You can define strings using double quotes\\nand you can define strings using single, sorry, using single quotes. However, for literal strings they are equivalent, but for the rest they are not equivalent. So, for example, if we do value is $foo, the $foo has been expanded like\\na string, substituted to the value of the foo variable in the shell. Whereas if we do this with a simple quote,\\nwe are just getting the $foo as it is and single quotes won\\'t be replacing. Again, it\\'s really easy to write a script, assume that\\nthis is kind of like Python, that you might be more familiar with, and not realize all that. And this is the way you will assign variables. Then bash also has control flow\\ntechniques that we\\'ll see later, like for loops, while loops, and one main\\nthing is you can define functions. We can access a function I have defined here. Here we have the MCD function, that\\nhas been defined, and the thing is so far, we have just kind of seen how\\nto execute several commands by piping into them, kind of saw that briefly yesterday. But a lot of times you want to do first\\none thing and then another thing. And that\\'s kind of like the sequential execution that we get here. Here, for example, we\\'re\\ncalling the MCD function. We, first, are calling the makedir command,\\nwhich is creating this directory. Here, $1 is like a special variable. This is the way that bash works, whereas in other scripting languages\\nthere will be like argv, the first item of the array argv\\nwill contain the argument. In bash it\\'s $1. And in general, a lot of things in bash will be dollar something and will be reserved, we will\\nbe seeing more examples later. And once we have created the folder,\\nwe CD into that folder, which is kind of a fairly common\\npattern that you will see. We will actually type this directly\\ninto our shell, and it will work and it will define this function. But sometimes\\nit\\'s nicer to write things in a file. What we can do is we can source\\nthis. And that will execute this script in our shell and load it. So now it looks like nothing happened,\\nbut now the MCD function has been defined in our shell. So\\nwe can now for example do MCD test, and now we move from\\nthe tools directory to the test directory. We both created the\\nfolder and we moved into it. What else. So a result is... We can access the first argument with $1. There\\'s a lot more reserved commands, for example $0 will be the name of the script, $2 through $9 will be the second\\nthrough the ninth arguments that the bash script takes.\\nSome of these reserved keywords can be directly used\\nin the shell, so for example $? will get you the error code\\nfrom the previous command, which I\\'ll also explain briefly. But for example, $_ will get\\nyou the last argument of the previous command. So another way\\nwe could have done this is we could have said like \"mkdir test\" and instead of rewriting test, we\\ncan access that last argument as part of the (previous command), using $_ like, that will be replaced with\\ntest and now we go into test. There are a lot of them, you\\nshould familiarize with them. Another one I often use is called \"bang\\nbang\" (\"!!\"), you will run into this whenever you, for example, are trying\\nto create something and you don\\'t have enough permissions. Then, you can do \"sudo !!\" and then that will replace the command in there and now you can just try doing that. And now it will prompt you for a password, because you have sudo permissions. Before, I mentioned the, kind\\nof the error command. Yesterday we saw that, in general, there are different ways a process can communicate with other processes or commands. We mentioned the standard\\ninput, which also was like getting stuff through the standard input, putting stuff into the standard output. There are a couple more interesting\\nthings, there\\'s also like a standard error, a stream where you write errors that happen with your program and you don\\'t\\nwant to pollute the standard output. There\\'s also the error code,\\nwhich is like a general thing in a lot of programming languages, some way of reporting how the\\nentire run of something went. So if we do something like echo hello and we query for the value, it\\'s zero. And it\\'s zero because everything went okay and there weren\\'t any issues. And a zero exit code is the same as you will get in a language like C, like 0 means everything\\nwent fine, there were no errors. However, sometimes things won\\'t work. Sometimes, like if we try to grep\\nfor foobar in our MCD script, and now we check for that\\nvalue, it\\'s 1. And that\\'s because we tried to search for the foobar string in the MCD script and it wasn\\'t there. So grep doesn\\'t print anything, but let us know that things didn\\'t work by giving us a 1 error code. There are some interesting commands like \"true\", for example, will always have a zero error code, and false will always\\nhave a one error code. Then there are like these logical operators that you can use to do some sort of conditionals.\\nFor example, one way... you also have IF\\'s and ELSE\\'s, that\\nwe will see later, but you can do something like \"false\", and echo \"Oops fail\". So here we have two commands connected\\nby this OR operator. What bash is gonna do here, it\\'s\\ngonna execute the first one and if the first one didn\\'t work, then it\\'s gonna execute the second one. So here we get it, because it\\'s gonna try to do a logical\\nOR. If the first one didn\\'t have a zero error code, it\\'s gonna try to\\ndo the second one. Similarly, if we instead of use \"false\", we\\nuse something like \"true\", since true will have a zero error code, then the second one will be short-circuited and it won\\'t be printed. Similarly, we have an AND\\noperator which will only execute the second part if the first one ran without errors. And the same thing will happen. If the first one fails, then the second\\npart of this thing won\\'t be executed. Kind of not exactly related to that, but\\nanother thing that you will see is that no matter what you execute,\\nthen you can concatenate commands using a semicolon in the same line, and that will always print. Beyond that, what we haven\\'t\\nseen, for example, is how you go about getting the output\\nof a command into a variable. And the way we can do that is\\ndoing something like this. What we\\'re doing here is we\\'re getting\\nthe output of the PWD command, which is just printing the\\npresent working directory where we are right now. And then we\\'re storing that\\ninto the foo variable. So we do that and then we ask\\nfor foo, we view our string. More generally, we can do this thing\\ncalled command substitution by putting it into any string. And since we\\'re using double quotes\\ninstead of single quotes that thing will be expanded and it will tell us that we are\\nin this working folder. Another interesting thing is, right now,\\nwhat this is expanding to is a string instead of It\\'s just expanding as a string. Another nifty and lesser known tool\\nis called process substitution, which is kind of similar. What it will do... it will, here for example, the \"&lt;(\",\\nsome command and another parenthesis, what that will do is: that will execute,\\nthat will get the output to kind of like a temporary file and it will\\ngive the file handle to the command. So here what we\\'re doing is we\\'re getting... we\\'re LS\\'ing the directory, putting\\nit into a temporary file, doing the same thing for the\\nparent folder and then we\\'re concatenating both files. And this will, may be really handy, because\\nsome commands instead of expecting the input coming from the stdin,\\nthey are expecting things to come from some file that is giving\\nsome of the arguments. So we get both things concatenated. I think so far there\\'s been a lot of\\ninformation, let\\'s see a simple, an example script where we\\nsee a few of these things. So for example here we have a string and we have this $date. So $date is a program. Again there\\'s a lot of programs\\nin UNIX you will kind of slowly familiarize with a lot of them. Date just prints what the current date is\\nand you can specify different formats. Then, we have these $0 here. $0 is the name of the script that we\\'re running. Then we have $#, that\\'s the number\\nof arguments that we are giving to the command, and then $$ is the process\\nID of this command that is running. Again, there\\'s a lot of these dollar\\nthings, they\\'re not intuitive because they don\\'t have like a mnemonic way of remembering, maybe, $#. But it can be... you will just be seeing them and getting familiar with them. Here we have this $@, and that will\\nexpand to all the arguments. So, instead of having to assume that, maybe say, we have three arguments\\nand writing $1, $2, $3, if we don\\'t know how many arguments we\\ncan put all those arguments there. And that has been given to a\\nfor loop. And the for loop will, in time, get the file variable and it will be giving each one of the arguments. So what we\\'re doing is, for every\\none of the arguments we\\'re giving. Then, in the next line we\\'re running the grep command which is just search for\\na substring in some file and we\\'re searching for the string foobar in the file. Here, we have put the variable\\nthat the file took, to expand. And yesterday we saw that if we care\\nabout the output of a program, we can redirect it to somewhere, to save it\\nor to connect it to some other file. But sometimes you want the opposite. Sometimes, here for example, we care... we\\'re gonna care about the error code. About\\nthis script, we\\'re gonna care whether the grep ran successfully or it didn\\'t. So we can actually discard\\nentirely what the output... like both the standard output and the\\nstandard error of the grep command. And what we\\'re doing is we\\'re redirecting the output to /dev/null which is kind of like a special device in UNIX systems where you can like write and it will be discarded. Like you can write no matter how much you want, there, and it will be discarded.\\nAnd here\\'s the \"&gt;\" symbol that we saw yesterday for redirecting\\noutput. Here you have a \"2&gt;\" and, as some of you might have guessed by now, this is for redirecting the standard error, because those those two streams are separate, and you kind of have to tell bash what to do with each one of them. So here, we run, we check if the file has foobar, and if the file has foobar then it\\'s going to have a zero code. If it doesn\\'t have foobar, it\\'s gonna have a nonzero error code. So that\\'s exactly what we check. In this if part of the command we say \"get me the error code\". Again, this $? And then we have a comparison operator which is \"-ne\", for \"non equal\". And some other programming languages\\nwill have \"==\", \"!=\", these symbols. In bash there\\'s like a reserved set of comparisons and it\\'s mainly because there\\'s a lot of things you might want to test for when you\\'re in the shell. Here for example we\\'re just checking for two values, two\\ninteger values, being the same. Or for example here, the \"-F\" check will let us know if a file exists, which is something that you will run into very, very commonly. I\\'m going back to the example. Then, what happens when we if the file did not have\\nfoobar, like there was a nonzero error code, then we print \"this file doesn\\'t have any foobar, we\\'re going to add one\". And what we do is we echo this \"# foobar\", hoping this is a comment to the file and then we\\'re using the operator \"&gt;&gt;\" to append at the end of the file. Here since the file has been fed through the script, and we don\\'t\\nknow it beforehand, we have to substitute the variable of the filename. We can\\nactually run this. We already have correct permissions in this script and we can give a few examples. We have a\\nfew files in this folder, \"mcd\" is the one we saw at the beginning for the MCD function, some other \"script\" function and we can even feed the own script to itself\\nto check if it has foobar in it. And we run it and first we can\\nsee that there\\'s different variables that we saw, that have been successfully expanded. We have the date, that has been replaced to the current time, then we\\'re running this program, with three arguments, this randomized PID, and then it\\'s telling us MCD doesn\\'t have any foobar, so we are adding a new one, and this script file doesn\\'t have one. So now for example let\\'s look at MCD and it has the comment that we were looking for. One other thing to know when you\\'re\\nexecuting scripts is that here we have like three completely different arguments but very commonly you will be giving arguments that can be more succinctly given in some way. So for example here if we wanted to refer to all the \".sh\" scripts we could just do something like \"ls *.sh\" and this is a way of filename expansion\\nthat most shells have that\\'s called \"globbing\". Here, as you might expect, this is gonna say anything that has any kind of sort of characters and ends up with \"sh\". Unsurprisingly, we get \"example.sh\"\\nand \"mcd.sh\". We also have these \"project1\" and \"project2\", and if there were like a... we can do a\\n\"project42\", for example And now if we just want to refer\\nto the projects that have a single character, but not two characters afterwards, like any other characters, we can use the question mark. So \"?\"\\nwill expand to only a single one. And we get, LS\\'ing, first \"project1\" and then \"project2\". In general, globbing can be very powerful.\\nYou can also combine it. A common pattern is to use what\\nis called curly braces. So let\\'s say we have an image,\\nthat we have in this folder and we want to convert this image from PNG to JPG or we could maybe copy it, or... it\\'s a really common pattern, to have\\ntwo or more arguments that are fairly similar and you want to do something\\nwith them as arguments to some command. You could do it this way, or more\\nsuccinctly, you can just do \"image.{png,jpg}\" And here, I\\'m getting some color feedback,\\nbut what this will do, is it\\'ll expand into the line above. Actually, I can ask zsh to do that for\\nme. And that what\\'s happening here. This is really powerful. So for example you can do something like... we could do... \"touch\" on a bunch of foo\\'s, and\\nall of this will be expanded. You can also do it at several levels\\nand you will do the Cartesian... if we have something like this,\\nwe have one group here, \"{1,2}\" and then here there\\'s \"{1,2,3}\",\\nand this is going to do the Cartesian product of these two expansions and it will expand\\ninto all these things, that we can quickly \"touch\". You can also combine the asterisk\\nglob with the curly braces glob. You can even use kind of ranges.\\nLike, we can do \"mkdir\" and we create the \"foo\" and the\\n\"bar\" directories, and then we can do something along these lines. This is going to expand to \"fooa\", \"foob\"... like all these combinations, through \"j\", and then the same for \"bar\". I haven\\'t really tested it... but yeah, we\\'re getting\\nall these combinations that we can \"touch\". And now, if we touch something that is different between these\\ntwo [directories], we can again showcase the process\\nsubstitution that we saw earlier. Say we want to check what\\nfiles are different between these two folders. For us it\\'s obvious,\\nwe just saw it, it\\'s X and Y, but we can ask the shell to do\\nthis \"diff\" for us between the output of one LS and the other LS. Unsurprisingly we\\'re getting: X is only in the first folder and Y is only in the second folder. What is more is, right now, we have only seen\\nbash scripts. If you like other scripts, like for some tasks bash\\nis probably not the best, it can be tricky. You can actually\\nwrite scripts that interact with the shell implemented in a lot of different languages. So for\\nexample, let\\'s see here a Python script that has a magic line at the beginning that I\\'m not explaining for now. Then we have \"import sys\", it\\'s kind of like... Python is not,\\nby default, trying to interact with the shell so you will have to import some library. And then we\\'re doing a really silly thing of just iterating over \"sys.argv[1:]\". \"sys.argv\" is kind of similar to what\\nin bash we\\'re getting as $0, $1, &amp;c. Like the vector of the arguments, we\\'re\\nprinting it in the reversed order. And the magic line at the beginning is called a shebang and is the way that the shell will know how to run this program. You can always do something like \"python script.py\", and then \"a b c\" and that will work, always, like that. But what if we want to make this to be executable from the shell? The way the shell knows that it has to use python as the interpreter to run this file is using that first line. And that first line is giving it the path to where that thing lives. However, you might not know. Like, different machines will have probably different places where they put python and you might not want to assume where python is installed, or any other interpreter. So one thing that you can do is use the \"env\" command. You can also give arguments in the shebang, so what we\\'re doing here is specifying run the \"env\" command, that is for pretty much every\\nsystem, there are some exceptions, but like for pretty much every system it\\'s is in \"usr/bin\", where a lot of binaries live, and then we\\'re calling it with the argument \"python\". And then that will make use of the path environment variable that we saw in the first lecture. It\\'s gonna search in that path for the Python binary and then it\\'s gonna use that to interpret this file. And that will make this more portable so it can be run in my machine, and your machine\\nand some other machine. Another thing is that the bash is not really like modern, it was developed a while ago. And sometimes it can be tricky to debug. By default, and the ways it will fail sometimes are intuitive like the way we saw before of like foo command not existing, sometimes it\\'s not. So there\\'s like a really nifty tool that we have linked in the lecture notes, which is called \"shellcheck\", that will kind of give you both warnings and syntactic errors and other things that you might\\nnot have quoted properly, or you might have misplaced spaces in your files. So for example for\\nextremely simple \"mcd.sh\" file we\\'re getting a couple of errors saying hey, surprisingly, we\\'re missing a shebang, like this might not interpret it correctly if you\\'re it at a different system. Also, this CD is taking a command and it might not expand properly so instead of using CD you might want to use something like CD and then an OR and then an \"exit\". We go back to what we explained earlier, what this will do is like if the CD doesn\\'t end correctly, you cannot CD into the folder because either you don\\'t have permissions, it doesn\\'t exist... That will give a nonzero error command, so you will execute exit and that will stop the script instead of continue executing as if you were in a place that you are actually not in. And actually\\nI haven\\'t tested, but I think we can check for \"example.sh\" and here we\\'re getting that we should be checking the exit code in a\\ndifferent way, because it\\'s probably not the best way, doing it this way. One last remark I want to make is that when you\\'re writing bash scripts or functions for that matter, there\\'s kind of a difference between writing bash scripts in isolation like a thing that you\\'re gonna run, and a thing that you\\'re gonna load into your shell. We will see some of this in the command line environment lecture, where we will kind of be tooling with the bashrc and the\\nsshrc. But in general, if you make changes to for example where you are, like if you CD into a bash script and you just execute that bash script, it won\\'t CD into the shell are right now. But if you have loaded the code directly into your shell, for example you load... you source the function and then you execute the function then you will get those side effects. And the same goes for defining variables into the shell. Now I\\'m going to talk about some\\ntools that I think are nifty when working with the shell. The first was also briefly introduced yesterday. How do you know what flags, or like what exact commands are. Like how I am supposed to know that LS minus L will list\\nthe files in a list format, or that if I do \"move - i\", it\\'s gonna like prom me for stuff. For that what you have is the \"man\" command. And the man command will kind of have like a lot of information of how will you go about... so for example here it will explain for the \"-i\" flag, there are all these options you can do. That\\'s actually pretty useful and it will work not only for really simple commands\\nthat come packaged with your OS but will also work with some tools\\nthat you install from the internet for example, if the person that did the installation made it so that the man package were also installed. So for example a tool that we\\'re gonna cover in a bit which is called \"ripgrep\" and\\nis called with RG, this didn\\'t come with my system but it has installed its own man page and I have it here and I can access it. For some commands the man page is useful but sometimes it can be tricky to decipher because it\\'s more kind of a documentation and a description of all the things the tool can do. Sometimes it will have examples but sometimes not, and sometimes the tool can do a lot of things so a couple of good tools that I use commonly are \"convert\" or \"ffmpeg\", which deal\\nwith images and video respectively and the man pages are like enormous. So there\\'s one neat tool called \"tldr\" that you can install and you will have like some nice kind of explanatory examples of how you want to use this command. And you can always Google for this, but I find myself saving going into the browser, looking about some examples and coming back, whereas \"tldr\" are community contributed and they\\'re fairly useful. Then, the one for \"ffmpeg\" has a lot of useful examples that are more nicely formatted (if you don\\'t have a huge font size for recording). Or even simple commands like \"tar\", that have a lot of options that you are combining. So for example, here you can be combining 2, 3... different flags and it can not be obvious, when you want to combine different ones. That\\'s how you would go about finding more about these tools.\\nOn the topic of finding, let\\'s try learning how to find files. You can always go \"ls\", and like you can go like \"ls project1\", and keep LS\\'ing all the way through. But maybe, if we already know that we want to look for all the folders called \"src\", then there\\'s probably a better command for doing that. And that\\'s \"find\". Find is the tool that, pretty much comes\\nwith every UNIX system. And find, we\\'re gonna give it... here we\\'re\\nsaying we want to call find in the current folder, remember that \".\" stands for the current folder, and we want the name to be \"src\" and we want the type to\\nbe a directory. And by typing that it\\'s gonna recursively go through the current directory and look for all these files, or folders in this case, that match this\\npattern. Find has a lot of useful flags. So for example, you can even test for the path to be in a way. Here we\\'re saying we want some number of folders, we don\\'t really care how many folders, and then we care about all the Python scripts, all the things with the extension\\n\".py\", that are within a test folder. And we\\'re also checking, just in cases really but we\\'re checking just that it\\'s also a type F, which stands for file. We\\'re getting all these files. You can also use different flags for things that are not the path or the name. You could check things that have been modified (\"-mtime\" is for the modification\\ntime), things that have been modified in the last day, which is gonna be pretty much everything. So this is gonna print a lot of the files we created and files that were already there. You can even use other things like size, the owner, permissions, you name it. What is even more powerful is, \"find\" can find stuff but it also can do stuff when you find those files. So we could look for all the files that have a TMP extension, which is a temporary extension, and then, we can tell \"find\" that\\nfor every one of those files, just execute the \"rm\" command for them. And that will just be calling \"rm\" with all these files. So let\\'s first execute it without, and then we execute it with it. Again, as with the command line philosophy, it looks like nothing happened. But since we have\\na zero error code, something happened - just that everything went correct and everything is fine. And now, if we look for these files,\\nthey aren\\'t there anymore. Another nice thing about the shell\\nin general is that there are these tools, but people will keep finding new ways, so alternative ways of writing these tools. It\\'s\\nnice to know about it. So, for example find if you just want to match\\nthe things that end in \"tmp\" it can be sometimes weird to do this\\nthing, it has a long command. There\\'s things like \"fd\", for example, that is a shorter command\\nthat by default will use regex and will ignore your gitfiles, so you don\\'t even search for them. It will color-code, it will have better\\nUnicode support... It\\'s nice to know about some of these tools. But, again, the main idea is that if you are aware\\nthat these tools exist, you can save yourself a lot of time from doing kind of menial and repetitive tasks. Another command to bear in mind is like \"find\". Some of you may be wondering, \"find\" is probably just actually going through a directory structure and looking for things but what if I\\'m doing a lot of \"finds\" a day? Wouldn\\'t it be better, doing kind of a database approach and build an index\\nfirst, and then use that index and update it in some way. Well, actually most Unix systems already do it and this is through the \"locate\" command and the way that the locate will be used... it will just look for paths in your file system that have the substring that you want. I actually don\\'t know if it\\nwill work... Okay, it worked. Let me try to do something like \"missing-semester\". You\\'re gonna take a while but it found all these files that are somewhere in my file system and since it has built an index already on them, it\\'s much faster. And then, to keep it updated, using the \"updatedb\" command\\nthat is running through cron, to update this database. Finding files, again, is really useful. Sometimes you\\'re actually concerned\\nabout, not the files themselves, but the content of the files. For that you can use the grep command that we have seen so far. So you could do something like grep foobar in MCD, it\\'s there. What if you want to, again, recursively\\nsearch through the current structure and look for more files, right? We don\\'t want to do this manually. We could use \"find\", and the \"-exec\", but actually \"grep\" has the \"-R\" flag\\nthat will go through the entire directory, here. And it\\'s telling us that oh we have the foobar line in example.sh at these three places and in this other two places in foobar. This can be really convenient. Mainly, the use case for this is you know you have written some code in some programming language, and you know it\\'s somewhere in your file system but you actually don\\'t know. But you can actually quickly search. So for example, I can quickly search for all the Python files that I have in my scratch folder where I used the request library. And if I run this, it\\'s giving me through all these files, exactly in what line it has been found. And here instead of using grep, which is fine, you could also do this, I\\'m using \"ripgrep\", which is kind of the same idea but\\nagain trying to bring some more niceties like color coding or file processing and other things. It think it has,\\nalso, unicode support. It\\'s also pretty fast so you are not paying like a\\ntrade-off on this being slower and there\\'s a lot of useful flags. You can say, oh, I actually want to get some context around those results. So I want to get like five\\nlines of context around that, so you can see where that import\\nlives and see code around it. Here in the import it\\'s not really useful but like if you\\'re looking for where you use the function, for example, it will be very handy. We can also do things like we can search, for example here,. A more advanced use, we can say, \"-u\" is for don\\'t ignore hidden files, sometimes you want to be ignoring hidden\\nfiles, except if you want to search config files, that are by default\\nhidden. Then, instead of printing the matches, we\\'re asking to do something\\nthat would be kind of hard, I think, to do with grep, out of my head, which is \"I want you to print all the files that don\\'t match the pattern I\\'m giving you\", which may be a weird thing to ask here but then we keep going... And this pattern here is a small regex which is saying at the beginning of the line I have a \"#\" and a \"!\", and that\\'s a shebang. Like that, we\\'re searching here for all the files that don\\'t have a shebang and then we\\'re giving it, here, a \"-t sh\" to only look for \"sh\" files, because maybe all your\\nPython or text files are fine without a shebang. And here it\\'s telling us \"oh, MCD is obviously missing a shebang\" We can even... It has like some nice flags, so for example if we include the \"stats\" flag it will get all these results but it will\\nalso tell us information about all the things that it searched. For example, the number of matches that it found,\\nthe lines, the file searched, the bytes that it printed, &amp;c. Similar as with \"fd\", sometimes\\nit\\'s not as useful using one specific tool or another and in fact, as ripgrep, there are several\\nother tools. Like \"ack\", is the original grep alternative that was written. Then the silver searcher, \"ag\", was another one... and they\\'re all pretty much interchangeable so maybe you\\'re at a system that has one and not the other, just knowing that you can use these things with these tools can be fairly useful. Lastly, I want to cover how you go about, not finding files\\nor code, but how you go about finding commands that you already some time figured out. The first, obvious\\nway is just using the up arrow, and slowly going through all your history,\\nlooking for these matches. This is actually not very efficient, as you probably guessed. So the bash\\nhas ways to do this more easily. There is the \"history\" command, that will print your history. Here I\\'m in zsh and\\nit only prints some of my history, but if I say, I want you to print everything\\nfrom the beginning of time, it will print everything from the beginning\\nof whatever this history is. And since this is a lot of results, maybe we care about the ones where we use the \"convert\" command to go from some\\ntype of file to some other type of file. Some image, sorry. Then, we\\'re getting all these results here, about all the ones that match this substring. Even more, pretty much all shells by default will link \"Ctrl+R\", the keybinding, to do backward search. Here we have backward search, where we can type \"convert\" and it\\'s finding the command that we just typed. And if we just keep hitting \"Ctrl+R\", it will kind of go through these matches and it will let re-execute it in place. Another thing that you can do, related to that, is you can use this really nifty tool called \"fzf\", which is like a fuzzy finder, like it will... It will let you do kind of like an interactive grep. We could do for example this, where we can cat our example.sh command, that will print print to the standard output, and then we can pipe it through fzf. It\\'s just getting all the lines and then we can\\ninteractively look for the string that we care about. And the nice thing about fzf is that, if you enable\\nthe default bindings, it will bind to your \"Ctrl+R\" shell execution and now you can quickly and dynamically like look for all the times you try to\\nconvert a favicon in your history. And it\\'s also like fuzzy matching,\\nwhereas like by default in grep or these things you have to write a regex or some expression that will match within here. Here I\\'m just typing \"convert\" and \"favicon\" and it\\'s just trying to do the best scan, doing the match in the lines it has. Lastly, a tool that probably you have\\nalready seen, that I\\'ve been using for not retyping these extremely long commands is this \"history\\nsubstring search\", where as I type in my shell, and both F fail to mention but both face which I think was originally introduced,\\nthis concept, and then zsh has a really nice implementation) what it\\'ll let you do is as you type the command, it will\\ndynamically search back in your history to the same command\\nthat has a common prefix, and then, if you... it will change as the match list stops working and then as you do the right arrow you can select that\\ncommand and then re-execute it. We\\'ve seen a bunch of stuff... I think I have a few minutes left so I\\'m going\\nto cover a couple of tools to do really quick directory listing\\nand directory navigation. So you can always use the \"-R\" to recursively\\nlist some directory structure, but that can be suboptimal, I cannot\\nreally make sense of this easily. There\\'s tool called \"tree\" that will\\nbe the much more friendly form of printing all the stuff, it will\\nalso color code based on... here for example \"foo\" is blue\\nbecause it\\'s a directory and this is red because it has execute permissions. But we can go even further than\\nthat. There\\'s really nice tools like a recent one called \"broot\" that\\nwill do the same thing but here for example instead of doing\\nthis thing of listing every single file, for example in bar we have these \"a\" through \"j\" files, it will say \"oh there are more, unlisted here\". I can actually start typing and it will again again facily match to the files that are there and I can quickly select them\\nand navigate through them. So, again, it\\'s good to know that these things exist so you don\\'t\\nlose a large amount of time going for these files. There are also, I think I have it installed also something more similar to what\\nyou would expect your OS to have, like Nautilus or one of the Mac\\nfinders that have like an interactive input where you can just use your\\nnavigation arrows and quickly explore. It might be overkill but you\\'ll\\nbe surprised how quickly you can make sense of some directory structure\\nby just navigating through it. And pretty much all of these tools\\nwill let you edit, copy files... if you just look for the options for them. The last addendum is kind of going places. We have \"cd\", and \"cd\" is nice, it will get you to a lot of places. But it\\'s pretty handy if you can like quickly go places, either you have been to recently or that you go frequently. And you can do this in many ways there\\'s probably... you can start thinking, oh I can make bookmarks, I can make... I can make aliases in the shell, that we will cover at some point, symlinks... But at this point, programmers have like built all these tools, so programmers have already figured out a really nice way of doing this. One way of doing this is using what is called \"auto jump\", which I\\nthink is not loaded here... Okay, don\\'t worry. I will cover it\\nin the command line environment. I think it\\'s because I disabled\\nthe \"Ctrl+R\" and that also affected other parts of the script.\\nI think at this point if anyone has any questions that are related to this,\\nI\\'ll be more than happy to answer them, if anything was left unclear. Otherwise, a there\\'s a bunch of\\nexercises that we wrote, kind of touching on these topics and we\\nencourage you to try them and come to office hours, where we can help you figure out how to do them, or some\\nbash quirks that are not clear.', metadata={'source': 'Lecture 2： Shell Tools and Scripting (2020) [kgII-YWo3Zw].en', 'lecture_name': 'lecture2', 'type': 'transcript'})]\n"
